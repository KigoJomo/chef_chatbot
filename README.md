# 🤖 AI Chat App - Built by AI, for Humans (Kind of...)

> "I didn't write a single line of code, and it works. What a time to be alive!" - Me, probably

## 🎭 The Plot Twist

This entire chat application was generated by Convex's Chef in **ONE PROMPT**. Yes, you read that right. No back-and-forth, no "can you fix this?", no stack overflow diving. Just pure, unadulterated AI magic. 

## ✨ Features

- 💬 Real-time chat (because who likes waiting?)
- 🔐 Authentication (both password and anonymous, for the shy folks)
- 🤖 OpenAI integration (so you can chat with your AI friends)
- 🎨 Pretty UI with TailwindCSS (because we're not savages)
- 📱 Responsive design (works on your phone, tablet, and that ancient desktop)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (because JavaScript alone gives me trust issues)
- **Backend**: Convex (the real MVP here)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (utility classes go brrr)
- **AI**: OpenAI (the puppet master)
- **Auth**: Convex Auth (keeping the bad guys out)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KigoJomo/convex-chatbot.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key and other secrets

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 🤔 How It Works

1. User types something witty
2. Message gets stored in Convex's database
3. OpenAI thinks really hard about a response
4. Response streams back in real-time
5. Everyone is impressed
6. Repeat

## 🎯 The Plot Thicker

The wildest part? This entire app was generated by AI. I'm basically just the person who pressed "Generate" and wrote this README. I'm not sure if I should put this on my resume or keep it as my secret shame.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Although, let's be honest, the AI probably does a better job than us at this point. But if you insist:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request
6. Wonder why you're not just using AI to do this
